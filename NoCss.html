<h1 id="the-resource-curse">The Resource Curse</h1>
<p>Why is Africa still so poor? This is a question often asked by people around the globe. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is the resource curse. This is a key concept within the field of development economics, which states that countries with a relatively high endowment of natural resources tend to experience less economic development than other countries. Development economics focuses on this link between natural resources and economic growth, and finds that it is usually negatively related. This canon will briefly introduce the field of development economics and its importance for understanding the resource curse. The resource curse will then be explained using important economic models and ideas, before presenting the importance of institution quality. Since there is much debate as to whether the resource curse actually exists, a classic example of it will be presented together with a model example of how it can be solved.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-the-resource-curse-relevant"><em>Why is the resource curse relevant?</em></h3>
<p>It seems intuitive that discovering natural resources will quickly lead to profits and economic growth. Such a discovery could not only create economic prosperity, but may encourage various social, infrastructural and political developments too. Unfortunately, the opposite effect seems to be true, and is predominantly persistent in developing countries. For these countries, a boost in economic development would be extremely valuable, since populations are living on subsistence levels and barely making ends meet. Sadly, the discovery of natural resources often creates various adverse issues, which destroy any hopes for economic development. Authoritarianism, corruption, and conflict are endemic in many resource-rich countries, supporting the argument for the resource curse. So-called oil states are 50% more likely to have an authoritarian ruler, while research shows that oil states are no richer than they were in 1980, in contrast to other developing countries that have performed relatively well over this time period [Wenar, 2016, xv][]. Figure 1 shows how higher corruption levels, which is correlated with authoritarianism, are related to lower overall well-being, represented by the Human Development Index. Solving the resource curse and creating a positive relationship between natural resources and economic development is paramount in shifting poor countries towards development.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-development-economics-and-how-is-it-relevant-to-the-resource-curse"><em>What is development economics, and how is it relevant to the resource curse?</em></h3>
<p>Development economics is the study of economic development, which focuses foremost on trying to identify and explain why some countries experience greater economic development than others [Raj, 2007][]. It is concerned with increasing understanding of the drivers of poverty, with the intention of providing methods of escaping this situation. In order to understand development economics, one must understand what development is. Development is defined as the improvement of human well-being, represented by economic growth and income, as well as by health and education indicators such as health status, literacy, and life-expectancy. It is a unique and fundamental field, due to its strong relation to social sciences and humanities, which studies resource allocation, human behaviour, institutional arrangements, and private and public policy [Barrett, 2007][]. Also of great interest to development economists is institutional quality, as strong institutions are necessary to facilitate economic exchanges and investments and solve market failures such as monopolies, externalities and imperfect information. [Raj, 2007]: http://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/Papers/RayPalgrave.pdf [Barrett, 2007]: http://barrett.dyson.cornell.edu/Papers/Introduction Final.pdf</p>
<p>The resource curse is particularly well explained within the discipline of development economics, as the phenomenon is often found in developing countries, struggling to escape poverty. Many of these developing countries are abundant in various natural resources, but do not seem to be able to increase economic development. Where it is expected that those countries, highly endowed with natural resources, would actually perform well economically, research has shown that the opposite is the case. The curse of resource abundance can lead to corruption, environmental damage, conflict, and slow economic growth. Development economics is well equipped to study this phenomenon and propose possible solutions.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="basic-economic-concepts">Basic Economic Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="heckscher-ohlin-model"><em>Heckscher-Ohlin model</em></h3>
<p>In order to understand why and how countries specialise and trade in certain goods, economic models of international trade have been designed. One such model is the Heckscher-Ohlin trade model. According to this stylised model, there are two countries, and two goods, which are produced using two input factors with different relative intensities. Countries are relatively more effective at producing the good that uses more of the input that is abundant in a particular country (Krugman et al., 2012). We say that this country has a comparative advantage in this good. When the two countries trade, each country will export this ‘specialised’ product to the other country. Hence, we can expect that a relatively resource rich country will have also export big amounts in resources. The model also predicts that the sector in which the foreign country has a comparative advantage will shrink in the home country, as most of its resources are poured into its ‘specialised sector’ instead. This may explain why sectors other than natural resources tend to struggle in resource rich countries.</p>
<h3 id="terms-of-trade"><em>Terms of trade</em></h3>
<p>A country’s terms of trade is its price of exports relative to the price of imports. You can compute this by dividing the country’s export prices by its import prices. An increase in the terms of trade will raise a country’s overall welfare, as it will increase its ability to buy imports, while a decrease in the terms of trade will harm overall welfare.</p>
<h3 id="standard-trade-model"><em>Standard trade model</em></h3>
<p>The standard trade model combines insights from many international trade models, including theories of comparative advantage and resource abundance. The standard trade model states that economic growth has the capacity to deteriorate the terms of trade of a country, if growth is biased. Growth is said to be biased if it occurs in only one sector. When growth is biased towards a country's export sector, supply of this good increases, lowering its relative price and therefore the country’s terms of trade (Krugman et al., 2012). As we have seen under the Heckscher Ohlin model, biased growth is likely to occur in sectors that use production technologies that are intensive in the good in which a country is abundant. Hence, in resource rich countries, biased growth in the resource sector may lead to a decline in the countries terms of trade, decreasing the country's overall welfare and possibly contributing to the resource curse.</p>
<h3 id="caveat-to-the-trade-models"><em>Caveat to the trade models</em></h3>
<p>However, according to Krugman et al. (2012) most empirical evidence states that differences in resource abundance cannot explain the pattern of world factor prices and world trade alone. To explain this pattern, you would also need to allow for substantial international differences in technology. So, countries with an abundance of natural resources do not necessarily export goods that are intensive in the use of these inputs. Furthermore, the Heckscher-Ohlin model and the standard trade model contain a lot of unrealistic assumptions which may mean that they do not apply to cases in which the resource curse is present (Krugman et al., 2012).</p>
<h3 id="the-dutch-disease"><em>The Dutch Disease</em></h3>
<p>When a country’s economic focus is on extracting its natural resources, it has the tendency to harm its other economic sectors. The harming of other sectors results from two different mechanisms. The first mechanism is related to the allocation of labour and capital in a country. If a country has an economic focus on extracting natural resources, it will tend to concentrate its supply of labour and capital in this sector [Corden and Neary, 1982][]. As a result, this labour and capital will not be available for use in other sectors, such as the manufacturing sector. This leaves those sectors with fewer resources, making them less competitive both nationally and internationally. [Corden and Neary, 1982]: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2232670</p>
<p>The second mechanism at work is related to the fact that a high inflow of foreign currency (e.g. from countries buying oil) drives up the value of the domestic currency. This is called a currency appreciation, meaning that the foreign currencies now have a comparative advantage over the domestic one. When the value of the domestic currency appreciates, other sectors such as the manufacturing sector, which already suffered losses in labour and capital, also have to deal with this comparative disadvantage and become even less attractive [Corden, 1984][]. Thus, demand for goods in sectors other than the resource sector declines further, impeding economic growth as a result. These two mechanisms combined are called the Dutch Disease. [Corden, 1984]: https://www.jstor.org/stable/2662669?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents   ###<em>Volatile revenues &amp; inefficient spending</em> Revenues from natural resource extraction tend to be more volatile than revenues from other sectors. This is because commodity prices (the international market price for natural resources) tend to fluctuate quite heavily over time, relative to other traded goods. This volatility is for example visible in the oil price where in 2014 the price was about 100 US$ per barrel and a year later suddenly about 50 US$ [WorldBank, 2016][]. The commodity volatility harms countries which depend on natural resources more than other countries [Blattman et al., 2007][]. Additionally, government revenues in resource-rich countries are closely linked to natural resource revenues, since these governments often enforce high taxes on the extraction of natural resources (for example 70% on oil extraction in Norway) or through the collection of revenues via state-owned extraction enterprises. [WorldBank, 2016]: http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/143081476804664222/CMO-October-2016-Full-Report.pdf [Blattman et al., 2007]: http://chrisblattman.com/documents/research/2007.Winners%26Losers.JDE.pdf</p>
<p>This revenue volatility creates difficulties for a government to properly budget their expenses [National Resource Governance Institute, 2015][]. In a cycle with high natural resource revenues, governments tend to overspend on inefficient projects such as building monuments. This goes together with high amounts of borrowing, encouraged by the good credit ratings that are caused by the high natural resource revenues. For example a sudden price drop causes the revenues of the natural resources to fall as well. Possibly, governments then have high accumulated amounts of debt. In combination with their current low income, it can result in a debt crisis. Examples can be found in Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela in the 1980s. Governments of natural resource abundant countries also tend to have an overall inefficient spending. In particular these governments tend to spend too much on for example (inefficient) fuel subsidies and underspend on for example education [Robinson et al., 2006][] [van der Ploeg, 2010][]. [National Resource Governance Institute, 2015]: http://www.resourcegovernance.org/sites/default/files/nrgi_Resource-Curse.pdf [Robinson et al., 2006]: http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/jr_polfoundations.pdf [van der Ploeg, 2010]: https://ideas.repec.org/p/ces/ceswps/_3125.html.</p>
<h2 id="institutions">Institutions</h2>
<p>Besides the basic economic mechanisms behind the resource curse, there are also some non-economic mechanisms which affect development in resource rich countries. Institutions, or the lack of good institutions, might also cripple a country in its development [Bourguignon and Verdier, 2000][], and are therefore of great interest to development economists. [Bourguignon and Verdier, 2000]: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.452.5716&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</p>
<h3 id="popular-resource-sovereignty"><em>Popular Resource Sovereignty</em></h3>
<p>Popular resource sovereignty is a concept that relates to property rights and the ownership of a nation’s natural resources. Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights state the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All people have the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.</li>
<li>All peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, according to accepted international human rights treaties, all peoples have the right to determine how their natural resources are managed. In other words, natural resources are the sovereign property of the people, not the companies, governments or rebels who extract them, unless the people decide to assign property or extraction rights to these parties. However, in order for popular resource sovereignty to be satisfied, institutions must be in place that allow peoples the political and economic freedom to self-determination. This runs antithesis to many regimes in resource rich countries, which tend to be ruled by authoritarians (Wenar, 2016, 190-199).</p>
<h3 id="natural-resource-rents-and-authoritarianism"><em>Natural Resource Rents and Authoritarianism</em></h3>
<p>According to philosopher Leif Wenar, authoritarian rulers have four main sources of income which they may use to hold onto their power. These are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Taxes from an empowered people.</li>
<li>Resource rents</li>
<li>Aid from allies (strategic rents)</li>
<li>Debt from foreign loans.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first of these options implies that citizens must have the political, educational and economic freedoms necessary to generate enough tax income in order to finance an authoritarian regime. However, this implies an empowered people who are more often than not in a position to overthrow this regime. Options three and four carry with them additional costs such as military aid or interest payments. However, under an authoritarian regime where people are denied the right to self-determination, dictators are able to extract resources and use the rents to finance their regime (and line their own pockets) at no extra cost to the regime. As such a dictator also has less need to collect taxes, and can continue to restrict economic growth in sectors other than resources by denying its people the institutions and opportunities necessary to facilitate economic activity and growth (Wenar, 2016, 24-27).</p>
<h3 id="property-rights"><em>Property Rights</em></h3>
<p>Because the above mentioned regimes do not require economic growth in sectors other than resources, institutions such as property rights tend to remain weak, which can cause development to occur at a considerably lower rate. Think for example of a case where people create a successful business in a weak institution country. In this situation, weak institutions will most likely not be able to prevent the elite from “capturing” this business, due to a lack of properly defined property rights. The incentives for the inhabitants of that country to be innovative and create their own businesses will be heavily damaged by this breach in property rights and will cause development to occur at a slower rate [Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006][]. [Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006]: http://economics.mit.edu/files/4471</p>
<h2 id="curse-or-choice-does-the-resource-curse-really-exist">Curse or Choice, does the Resource Curse really exist?</h2>
<h3 id="the-argument-for"><em>The argument for:</em></h3>
<p>According to Sachs and Warner’s seminal paper [2001][] ‘‘Natural resources and economic development: the curse of natural resources’, empirical support for the resource curse is strong. Sachs and Warner (2001) argue that the resource curse exists because the phenomenon of low economic development in resource rich countries cannot easily be explained by other variables or other ways of measuring resource abundance. In their paper, they show that by the effect of natural resource extraction on terms of trade, ultimately leading to less economic growth (See figure 2).</p>

(2006)][] [Papyrakis, E., &amp; Gerlagh, R. (2004)][] [Stevens, P. (2003)][] [Mehlum, H., Moene, K., &amp; Torvik, R.

<h3 id="the-argument-against"><em>The argument against:</em></h3>
<p>Some economists deny the existence of a curse, as evidence exists of resource rich countries that perform well. As the classic paper by Gavin Wright and Jesse Czelusta [2004][] ‘The myth of the resource curse’ shows, Norway used its knowledge regarding deep-water drilling platforms to create a new export good. Thus, instead of neglecting the export manufacturing sector, Norway found a way to expand it. Furthermore, the authors argue that other solutions to the resource curse exist, and are primarily related how resources rents are spent. By ensuring that resource rents are reinvested in valuable assets such as strong institutions or infrastructure that encourage growth in other sectors, the negative effects of the Dutch Disease can be negated.

<h3 id="q.-why-is-africa-so-poor"><em>Q. Why is Africa so poor?</em></h3>
<p>Example Country: Cameroon</p>
<p>Cameroon is located in the west of Africa, and has a population of about 22.5 million people. The GDP of Cameroon is around $30.790 billion, which corresponds to an income of roughly $1.299 per capita. Although there is an abundance of natural resources in Cameroon, it is still a poor country. In this example we show why Cameroon shows signs of the resource curse, and what the consequences of this are for the country.</p>
<p>In 1977 there was a large oil discovery in Cameroon, and this quickly became one of the biggest exports of the country. Before the discovery of oil, exports consisted mostly of coffee and cocoa, and the economy was growing relatively well. After the discovery of oil, there was an economic boom with an average economic growth of 9.4% between 1977 and 1986. This meant however, that the industry of Cameroon switched from the production of several products, to only one product: Oil. This resulted in the <a href="###*The%20Dutch%20Disease*">Dutch Disease</a> as described above, in which a large part of the investments done in the country were towards the oil sector. From 1987 onwards, so after the initial economic boom from the discovery of oil, things started to turn negatively for Cameroon. Around 1993 income per capita was about half of the 1986 per capita level, and to this date, GDP per capita is still only two thirds of the 1986 per capita income level. How could this be the case?</p>
<p>In Cameroon, roughly two-thirds of all the gains from oil went to the government, and not to private companies. The gains from oil are estimated to be around $20 billion dollars for the Government since 1970. Before the discovery of oil there were a lot of private firms, who exported a variety of products to the world, and provided a lot of opportunities for jobs and local investments. After the discovery of oil, the production of the country switched primarily to the export of oil. The government did not use the gains from the oil sector to invest in its country. So far, only 54% of the profits made from the oil sector even showed up on the government balance sheet, the rest just disappeared. Most of the investments made by the government were not directed towards education or infrastructure, but was spent in an inefficient way, just as a show of power from the government. This underspending in education and inefficient spending on monuments is a nice example of the problems that arise from the Resource Curse, as mentioned earlier<a href="###*Volatile%20revenues%20&amp;%20inefficient%20spending*">earlier</a> in this canon.</p>
<p>While the economic problems that arose in Cameroon already point towards a Resource Curse, there are other underlying issues that the country has. One example of this is a lack of proper institutions. Property rights in Cameroon were not well defined, and thus the Government could claim almost all of the oil rents for themselves. This explains why roughly two thirds of the oil production is owned by the Government. As described <a href="##Institutions">before</a>, this lack of institutions in property rights resulted in a small group of people staying into power. They used the oil rents for their own gains, and did not invest it back into the country.</p>
<p>Overall, the discovery of more natural resources seemed to have a negative impact on the growth and development levels in Cameroon. Although the Oil sector results in a lot of income, a lack of investment in public goods and the country itself result in a net cost for Cameroon. This example shows that more natural resources can actually hinder a country, and thus argues in favour of the existence of the Resource Curse.</p>
<h2 id="q.-what-effect-do-institutions-have-on-the-resource-curse"><em>Q. What effect do institutions have on the Resource Curse?</em></h2>
<p>Example Country: Former Soviet Union</p>
<p>As already mentioned the resource curse and the state of institutions are correlated. We look at the example of the Soviet Union, which fell apart in 1991. The successor states included Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, The Russian Federation, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. They all inherited very similar weak state institutions. However, the development of the public sector after the separation had great effect on how economic growth reacted to the ownership structure of oil. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan focused on expanding the public sector, which owned and controlled more than 50% of the oil sector. Azerbaijan also chose a state ownership structure but without control, owning less than 50% of the oil sector, and including foreign involvement. Lastly, Russia chose domestic private ownership and Kazakhstan chose a foreign private ownership structure of the oil sector.</p>
<p>Russia and Kazakhstan were better able to overcome their bad institutions and thus mitigate the effects of the resource curse, as can be seen in this graph of GDP per capita after the fall of the Soviet Union in figure 3.</p>
<p><img style="float: middle;" alt="" src="C:\Users\Joelle Duff\Documents\Master\AEA I\ResourceCurseSoviet.png"> Figure 3 – GDP per Capita former Soviet Union countries</p>
<p>One explanation for their success was the strong enforcement of <a href="###*Property%20Rights*">private property</a> in the oil sector for Russia and Kazakhstan. This made it more difficult for the state to rely on natural resources as its sole revenue base, meaning that they had to develop alternative fiscal resources. Moreover, the private sector were able to use their greater bargaining power to demand better fiscal institutions when property rights for the oil sector were changed, since they suffered from bad ones. So, this example shows that self-determination of resources, adequate property rights, more democratic systems, and overall good institutional quality encourage economic growth and help overcome the resource curse</p>
