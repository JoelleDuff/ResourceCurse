<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In recent years, interest in natural resources, environmental damage, and economic growth has steadily grown, and is often discussed in the field of environmental economics and development economics. In this paper we will briefly discuss these two disciplines, and introduce the topic of the resource curse. The resource curse states that countries largely endowed with natural resources, tend to have low economic development. This issue is related to both environmental and development economics, and incredibly important to understand in the context of sustainable economic development. Much research has been performed on the topic of the resources curse, and on its impact on economic development, but there is no general agreement regarding whether it actually exists. In the final section, the supporters and opponents of this debate will be presented, along with practical issues and questions regarding the resource curse.</p>
<h3 id="environmental-economics">Environmental Economics</h3>
<p>Environmental economics discusses the link between environment and economics, and includes various issues such as environmental degradation, trade-offs between economic goods and environmental quality, monetary values of environmental goods, limits to growth, sustainable development, resource conservation, and much more. The existing concerns with natural resources and environmental damage have increased economists’ awareness of the natural environment in which economics takes place, both as a source of resources and as a trash belt for wastes (Harris, 1996). Together with the increase in pollution, these trends led to the development of environmental economics in the 1960s (CeDEP, 2016). As the economy cannot grow sustainably indefinitely, environmental economists propose a system which incorporates the natural environment in which we live. This discipline has been developed within a neoclassical paradigm, focusing on market failures, inappropriate resource allocation, and the management of public goods. Alternatively, a different environmental approach to economics arose in the form of ecological economics. Academics in this field view the relationship between economics and the environment as central, and support a strong view of sustainability. This view of sustainability states that human and natural capital are complementary, and not substitutable.</p>
<p>Environmental economics is gradually evolving over time, as we learn more about the natural environment and resources around us (Hussen, 2004). Throughout history, economists have been classifying natural resources as one of the three basic resources: land, labour, and capital. Our current interpretation of natural resources includes all elements of the Earth’s natural endowments: air, water, the Earth’s crust, and radiation from the sun. These resources are commonly grouped into renewable and nonrenewable resources, depending on whether they are capable of regenerating themselves within a relatively short period or not. Renewable resources can be further divided into biological and flow resources. Biological resources are plant and animal species, which are able to regenerate but not after a certain threshold of exploitation. Flow resources include wind and water streams for example, and this renewal is regulated by atmospheric and hydraulic circulation. Nonrenewable resources exist only in a fixed supply or are only renewable within a very long time frame, deeming them useless for practical human purpose. Further distinctions can be made within nonrenewable resources, resources that are recyclable, such as metallics, and those that are not, such as fossil fuels.</p>
<h3 id="development-economics">Development Economics</h3>
<p>Development economics, is the study of economics of the developing world, and focuses on topics such as why some countries are poor and others rich, and how these inequalities can be explained (Raj, 2007). It is an unique and fundamental field, due to its strong relation with social sciences and humanities, which studies resource allocation, human behaviour, institutional arrangements, and private and public policy (Barrett, 2007). Development economics is concerned with increasing knowledge on poverty and ultimately providing methods of escaping this situation. In the 1970s development issues were seen as a result from excessive government interference. And by the 1980s, development economics was even seen as a useless search for anomalies in mainstream neoclassical economics. Today however, it is recognised as a field in economics of great importance, since many important theories discovered by development economists are applicable to economics in general, such as adverse selection, efficiency wage theory, rent-seeking and political economy, nonlinear pricing, etc.</p>
<p>Development economics looks not only at economic development and growth, but takes a broad approach to the issues in development and analyses these using analytical techniques preferred in economics (Lynn, 2003). One of the most important questions in development economics is, what is development? Generally, development is viewed as the improvement of human well-being, represented by economic growth and income, as well as by health and education indicators such as health status, literacy, and life-expectancy. Another important concept to discuss within development economics, is institutional quality. Institutions are necessary to facilitate economic exchanges and investments, as they ensure that the terms of exchanges and investments are legally enforceable and that property rights are respected. Additionally, institutions can help solve market failures such as monopolies, externalities and public goods, and imperfect information. In fact, Acemoglu and Robinson (2008) state that to understand underdevelopment, implies understanding why different countries are stuck in a political equilibrium and therefore have bad economic institutions.</p>
<h3 id="why-economics">Why Economics?</h3>
<p>As Harris (1996) mentions, it seems to be an oxymoron to view environmental issues from an economics perspective, as this field is commonly connected to consumerism and greed. But in fact, this is far from true. It is very important to include natural resources in economic theory for many different reasons, such as: the natural environment is a factor of production, finite resources create scarcity, the economic value of resources is determined by consumer preferences, continuous technological advances augment the scarcity of resources, and waste is a by-product which is not accounted for whilst being put back in the economy. These arguments all stem from neoclassical economics, which is a meta-theory from which economic theories can be constructed (Weintraub, n.d.). Fundamental assumptions within this framework are (a) people make rational decisions, (b) people maximize their utility (i.e. consumption satisfaction) and firms maximize profits, and (c) people act independently on the basis of full and relevant information. It is within this perspective that the resource curse will be discussed.</p>

<h1 id="the-resource-curse">The Resource Curse</h1>
<p>The resource curse says that countries with an abundance of natural resources tend to have less economic growth, less democracy, and worse development outcomes than countries with fewer natural resources. According to Sachs and Warner (2001) the resource curse became a topic because since the early 1970s almost all resource-abundant countries stagnated in economic growth. Alternatively, according to Krugman, Obstfeld, and Melitz (2012, p. 134) and the Heckscher-Ohlin model, countries are more likely to produce relatively more of goods that use a lot of the factors of which they have an abundant supply. Because of this abundance, the countries are more likely to export these goods. Natural resources are part of the production factor land so countries with an abundance of natural resources are likely to export goods that are intensive in the use of the factor land.</p>
<p>In the standard trade model, growth will worsen the terms of trade of a country when the growth expands the ability of an economy to produce the goods that it was already exporting, more than it expands the economy’s ability to produce goods that compete with its imports (Krugman et al., 2012, p. 160). If a country’s terms of trade decline, its welfare declines as well. So, if countries with an abundance of natural resources have growth that expands their ability to produce goods that are intensive in the use of the factor land, their welfare might decline. This might explain why countries with an abundance of natural resources (factor land) tend to have less economic growth.</p>
<p>However, according to Krugman et al. (2012, p.134) most empirical evidence states that differences in resources cannot explain the pattern of world factor prices and world trade alone. To explain this pattern, you would also need to allow for substantial international differences in technology. So, countries with an abundance of natural resources do not necessarily export goods that are intensive in the use of the factor land. Furthermore, the Heckscher-Ohlin model and the standard trade model contain a lot of unrealistic assumptions which could also be a reason why the results do not apply when the resource curse appears.</p>
<h3 id="the-dutch-disease">The Dutch Disease</h3>
<p>When a country’s economic focus is on extracting its natural resources, it has the tendency to harm its other economic sectors. The harming of other sectors comes from two different mechanisms. The first one has to do with the focus of labour and capital in a country. If a country has an economic focus on extracting natural resources, it will also focus a lot of its labour and capital on this sector. This labour and capital will not be available for other sectors, such as the manufacturing sector. This leaves those sectors with less labour and capital, making them less competitive and thus creates a decline in those sectors. The second mechanism has to do with the fact that due to the high inflow of foreign currency (of countries buying for example oil) the value of the domestic currency can rise. When the value of the domestic currency increases, the (exporting) manufacturing sectors who already suffered due to the loss in labour and capital have to deal with the fact that their prices will be relatively higher compared to their foreign competitors. This makes them even less competitive, resulting again in a decline in those sectors. These two mechanisms combined are often called the Dutch Disease.</p>
<h3 id="volatile-revenues-inefficient-spending">Volatile revenues &amp; inefficient spending</h3>
<p>The extraction of natural resources also results in a rather volatile revenue flow. This volatility harms countries which depend on natural resources more than other countries (Blattman et al., 2007). Before receiving any revenue, large investments are made in order to discover a resource and set up a method of extraction. However, this still leaves room for great volatility due to the fact that the prices of natural resources are can fluctuate extremely over time. Government revenues of natural resource-extracting countries are often closely linked to the revenues of that natural resource. This can result from high taxes to the extraction of natural resources (for example 70% on oil extraction in Norway) or even from organizing the resource extraction using a state-owned company (of which the profits often flow into the budget of the country).</p>
<p>Combining revenue volatility and government revenue leads to a system where government has difficulties in properly budgeting their expenses (National Resource Governance Institute, 2015). In a cycle with a high natural resource revenues, governments tend to overspend on inefficient projects such as building monuments. This goes together with high amounts of borrowing, encouraged by the good credit ratings that are caused by the high natural resource revenues. Such a period of high natural resource revenues is often followed by a period with low natural resource revenues, for example caused by a sudden price drop. Governments have then accumulated high amounts of debt and have low income, which can lead to debt crises such as in Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela in the 1980s. Governments of natural resource abundant countries also tend to have an overall inefficient spending. In particular these governments tend to spend too much on for example (inefficient) fuel subsidies and underspend on for example education (Robinson et al., 2006; van der Ploeg, 2010).</p>
<h3 id="institutions">Institutions</h3>
<p>Besides all the economical mechanisms behind the resource curse, there are also some non-economical mechanisms which may have an influence on the resource curse. Institutions, or the lack of good institutions, might also cripple a country in its development (Bourguignon and Verdier, 2000). Theories argue that the lack of good institutions comes from the fact that a sole, high profitable source of income can easily be ‘captured’ by elites and be placed outside the regular system. This corruption can for example be seen in Nigeria (Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian, 2003). These elites often do not have the country's best interest in heart and will use the natural resource revenues for their own good. This creates widespread corruption throughout the country, which in turn causes a country to have weaker institutions. Weak institutions will not provide the same level of public service as good institutions do, which can cause the development to grow at a considerably lower rate. Think for example of a case where people create a successful business in a weak institution country. In this situation, weak institutions will most likely not be able to prevent the elite from “capturing” this business. The incentives for the inhabitants of that country to be innovative and create their own businesses will be heavily damaged by this breach in property rights and will cause the development to grow at a slower rate. Technological and even institutional improvements are thus often blocked by the elite, to ensure that their power will not be weakened (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006).</p>
<h3 id="is-it-a-curse-or-a-choice">Is it a curse or a choice?</h3>
<p>Norway is one of the many examples of how it should be done. As the classic paper by Gavin Wright and Jesse Czelusta (2004) ‘The myth of the resource curse’ shows, Norway uses its knowledge regarding deep-water drilling platforms to create a new export good. Thus, instead of neglecting the export manufacturing sector Norway finds a way to expand it. Other solutions to the resource curse have to do with the way of spending the resource revenues. Looking at some of the described mechanisms of the resource curse, the solution might look obvious: ensure that the resource revenue is use to create tangible assets, assets that are of use for the country. One of the best examples is infrastructure, since the government uses the revenues from the natural resources to invest in the economy, thereby creating growth in other sectors too. This is known as the absorptive capacity of the country, since the growth of these investments can directly negate the negative effects of the Dutch disease. Furthermore, such investments help counter inefficient spending by only focusing on growth-enhancing investments and overcoming weak institutions, and by not enabling the elite in “capturing” resource revenues. This is a proficient way to prevent or minimize the resource curse.</p>
<p>Another classic paper on the resource curse was written by Sachs and Warner (2001), called ‘Natural resources and economic development: the curse of natural resources’. According to this paper, empirical support for the resource curse is actually pretty strong. Sachs and Warner (2001) believe that the resource curse exists because the phenomenon is not easily explained by other variables or other ways of measuring resource abundance. In their paper, they show how little direct evidence exists that there is an omitted variable bias from unobserved geographical or climate variables or another omitted growth deterrent that could explain the resource curse. Sachs and Warner (2001) believe the resource curse is mainly explained by the fact that countries that are abundant in natural resources tend to have high prices, which result in less exports. This ultimately leads to countries having less economic growth.}</p>
