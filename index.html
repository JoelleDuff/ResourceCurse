<h1 id="the-resource-curse">The Resource Curse</h1>
<p>Why is Africa still so poor? The continent is rich in oil and minerals, this must be beneficial for economic growth, right? And why is there so much war and corruption in African countries?</p>
<p>These questions are often asked by researchers, politicians, humanitarians, and you and I. The ‘Resource curse’ offers a possible answer to these questions. This theory shows the interrelation between natural resources, conflict, corruption, and economic growth extremely well, and has been debated among scholars for years. It is a key concept within the field of development economics, and states that countries with a relatively high endowment of natural resources tend to experience less economic development than other countries. Development economics focuses on this link between natural resources and economic growth, and finds that there is usually a negative relation.</p>
<p>This canon will briefly introduce why the resource curse theory is relevant, and present it within the field of development economics. The resource curse will then be explained using important economic models and ideas, before presenting the importance of institutional quality. Since there is much debate as to whether the resource curse actually exists, examples will be presented which can both confirm and contradict the theory.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<h3 id="why-is-the-resource-curse-relevant"><em>Why is the resource curse relevant?</em></h3>
<p>It seems intuitive that discovering natural resources will quickly lead to profits and economic growth. Such a discovery could not only create economic prosperity, but may encourage various social, infrastructural and political developments too. Unfortunately, the opposite effect seems to be true, in particular for developing countries. For these countries, a boost in economic development would be extremely valuable, since populations are living on subsistence levels and barely making ends meet. Sadly, the discovery of natural resources often leads to adverse effects, which destroy any hopes for economic development. Instead of gaining from natural resources, many countries suffer from poor economic growth, weak institutions, and high levels of conflict.</p>
<p>Authoritarianism, corruption, and conflict are endemic in many resource-rich countries, which supports the argument for the resource curse. Research shows that so-called oil states are 50% more likely to have an authoritarian ruler and are no richer than they were in 1980, in contrast to other developing countries which have performed relatively well over this time period (Wenar, 2016). Below, figure 1 shows how higher corruption levels, which are correlated with authoritarianism, are related to lower overall well-being. This well-being is measured using the Human Development Index, a composite index of life-expectancy, education level, and gross national income per capita, which is thought to represent national development more comprehensively than GDP (<a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi">UNDP, 2016</a>).</p>

<p>Figure 1 – Human Development Index and Corruption (The Economist Online, 2011)</p>
<p>There are different opinions regarding the actual existence of the curse and the mechanisms at play. What is clear though, is that if it does exist, it could explain why developing countries often perform so poorly, even when they are rich in natural resources.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-development-economics-and-how-is-it-relevant-to-the-resource-curse"><em>What is development economics, and how is it relevant to the resource curse?</em></h3>
<p>Development economics is the study of economic development, which focuses on trying to identify and explain why some countries experience greater economic development than others (<a href="http://www.econ.nyu.edu/user/debraj/Papers/RayPalgrave.pdf">Raj, 2007</a>). It is concerned with increasing the general understanding of drivers of poverty, and intends to provide methods of escaping this situation. In order to understand development economics, one must understand what development is. Development is defined as the improvement of human well-being, represented by economic growth and income, as well as by health and education indicators such as health status, literacy, and life-expectancy. It is a unique and fundamental field due to its strong relation to social sciences and humanities, which studies resource allocation, human behaviour, institutional arrangements, and private and public policy (<a href="http://barrett.dyson.cornell.edu/Papers/Introduction Final.pdf">Barrett, 2007</a>).</p>
<p>Also of great interest to development economists is institutional quality, as strong institutions are necessary to facilitate economic exchanges and investments and solve market failures such as monopolies, externalities and imperfect information. These topics are all combined in the resource curse, which makes the development economics discipline particularly well-equipped to study this, and potentially discover ways to combat it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="basic-economic-concepts">Basic Economic Concepts</h2>
<p>In this section we will try to explain how the resource curse could possibly work. We will explain several possible mechanisms behind the resource curse, using models and other theories.</p>
<h3 id="heckscher-ohlin-modeldutch-disease"><em>Heckscher-Ohlin model/Dutch Disease</em></h3>
<p>How is it that a country which is resource-rich, is not able to profit from those resources? One possible cause could be that being resource-rich can harm other sectors. To explain this phenomenal we use the Heckscher-Ohlin model and the Dutch disease. The Heckscher-Ohlin trade model uses two countries and two goods. These goods are produced using two input factors. Each country has a different endowment of the two inputs. Countries are relatively more effective at producing the good that uses more of the input that is abundant in that particular country (Krugman et al., 2012). We say that this country has a comparative advantage in this good.</p>
<p>When the two countries trade, each country will export the good in which they have a comparative advantage to the other country. Hence, we can expect that a relatively resource-rich country will also export relatively more amounts of resources than a country that is not relatively resource-rich. When a country is abundant in resources and thus has a comparative advantage in this sector, it will focus heavily on this sector. This means that it will allocate a lot of its labour and capital to this sector (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2232670">Corden and Neary, 1982</a>). As a result, this labour and capital will not be available for use in other sectors, such as the manufacturing sector. This leaves those sectors with less resources, making them less competitive both nationally and internationally. This phenomenal is also part of the so-called Dutch disease and it thus states that sectors other than natural resources tend to struggle in resource rich countries, which might explain why countries who are resource-rich, are not able to profit from those resources.</p>
<p>The other mechanism of the Dutch disease is the fact that due to foreigners buying the resources there is a high inflow of foreign currency. This high inflow drives up the value of the domestic currency. Foreign countries now face relatively higher prices for the products of this country. Other sectors such as the manufacturing sector, which already suffered losses in labour and capital, become even less attractive due to their relatively high price when exported (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2662669?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Corden, 1984</a>). Thus, demand for goods in sectors other than the resource sector declines further, impeding economic growth and decreasing the country's overall welfare.</p>
<h3 id="standard-trade-model"><em>Standard trade model</em></h3>
<p>The standard trade model with two countries states that economic growth has the capacity to deteriorate the terms of trade of a country, if growth is biased. A country’s terms of trade is its price of exports relative to the price of imports. Growth is said to be biased if it occurs in only one sector. When growth is biased towards a country's export sector, supply of this good increases, lowering its relative price and therefore the country’s terms of trade (Krugman et al., 2012).</p>
<p>As we explained in the Heckscher-Ohlin model/Dutch Disease section, having a lot of resources may harm the other sectors in the resource-rich country. Hence, in these resource-rich countries, while the harmed sectors might not grow at all due to the lack of labour and capital, the resource sector might experience rapid growth due to the large allocation of labour and capital. Thus, biased growth can be seen in resource-rich countries and may lead to a decline in the countries terms of trade, which in term reduces the welfare of a country since the price of its resource-export declines.</p>
<p>When we expand the model to more than two countries the model has a different conclusion. It is likely that a resource-rich country is not able to influence the world price with raising its resource-supply (think of Australia exporting iron). In this case the world price remains equal, meaning that it would not harm the terms of trade. This means that a small resource-rich country should be able to benefit from their resource-export since it does not lower the price and the quantity of resources sold increases. For a country that is big enough to influence the world market price, the conclusion of the two country standard trade model holds; it lowers their terms of trade and thus lowers their welfare. Thus, whether a country benefits or not depends on the possible impact a country can have on the world market when we look at a multiple country standard trade model. Therefore, a negative terms of trade effect and its implications for the resource curse need not be present in small, exporting countries.</p>
<h3 id="caveat-to-the-trade-models"><em>Caveat to the trade models</em></h3>
<p>According to Krugman et al. (2012) most empirical evidence states that differences in resource abundance cannot explain the pattern of world factor prices and world trade alone. To explain this pattern, you would also need to allow for substantial international differences in technology. So, countries with an abundance of natural resources do not necessarily export goods that are intensive in the use of these inputs. Furthermore, the Heckscher-Ohlin model and the standard trade model contain unrealistic assumptions. Because of this, they might not directly apply to cases in which the resource curse is present (Krugman et al., 2012).</p>
<h3 id="volatile-revenues-inefficient-spending"><em>Volatile revenues &amp; inefficient spending</em></h3>
<p>We will now explain another mechanism that could explain the resource curse. Revenues from natural resource extraction tend to be more volatile than revenues from other sectors. This is because commodity prices (the international market price for natural resources) tend to fluctuate quite heavily over time, relative to other traded goods. This volatility is for example visible in the oil price where in 2014 the price was about 100 US$ per barrel and a year later suddenly about 50 US$ (<a href="http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/143081476804664222/CMO-October-2016-Full-Report.pdf">WorldBank, 2016</a>). The commodity volatility harms countries which depend on natural resources more than other countries (<a href="http://chrisblattman.com/documents/research/2007.Winners%26Losers.JDE.pdf">Blattman et al., 2007</a>). Additionally, government revenues in resource-rich countries are closely linked to natural resource revenues, since these governments often enforce high taxes on the extraction of natural resources (for example 70% on oil extraction in Norway) or through the collection of revenues via state-owned extraction enterprises.</p>
<p>This revenue volatility gives a government difficulties in properly budgeting their expenses (<a href="http://www.resourcegovernance.org/sites/default/files/nrgi_Resource-Curse.pdf">National Resource Governance Institute, 2015</a>). In a cycle with a high natural resource revenues, governments tend to overspend on inefficient projects such as building monuments. This goes together with high amounts of borrowing, encouraged by the good credit ratings that are caused by the high natural resource revenues. For example a sudden price drop causes the revenues of the natural resources to fall as well. Possibly, governments then have high accumulated amounts of debt. In combination with their current low income, it can result in a debt crisis. Examples can be found in Mexico, Nigeria and Venezuela in the 1980s. Governments of natural resource abundant countries also tend to have an overall inefficient spending. In particular these governments tend to spend too much on for example (inefficient) fuel subsidies and underspend on for example education (<a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/jr_polfoundations.pdf">Robinson et al., 2006</a>; <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/ces/ceswps/_3125.html">van der Ploeg, 2010</a>).</p>
<h2 id="institutions">Institutions</h2>
<p>Besides the basic economic mechanisms behind the resource curse, non-economic mechanisms may also affect development in resource rich countries. Institutions, or a lack thereof, can cripple a country’s development, and are therefore of great interest to development economists (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387800000869">Bourguignon and Verdier, 2000</a>). In countries with ‘strong’ institutions, legal, economic and social structures exist that allow markets to function efficiently and profits to be distributed equitably. Countries with ‘weak’ institutional quality, on the other hand, tend to be characterised by having weak property rights, high levels of bureaucracy, high corruption and a higher prevalence of authoritarianism. In this section, we will first briefly outline the potential impact of low institutional quality on economic development. We will then explain why resource rich countries might be more prone to authoritarianism and corruption, and what impact this might have on the predictions of the resource curse.</p>
<h3 id="weak-institutional-quality-and-the-rate-of-return"><em>Weak Institutional Quality and the Rate of Return</em></h3>
<p>Weak institutional quality refers to a situation in which a country’s institutions restrict its economic development. Examples of weak institutions are a lack of available schooling, inefficient credit markets, tedious bureaucracy and the presence of systemic corruption. To understand the impact weak institutions have on economic development, it is easiest to examine the effect each of these examples might have on the rate of return to investment. For example, a lack of available schooling will decrease the human capital of a population, which decreases workers’ productivity. Hence, workers will be able to produce less per unit invested compared to countries with high quality education, as they lack certain skills (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574068405010075">Banerjee and Duflo, 2005</a>).</p>
<p>Inefficient credit markets might mean that lenders are faced with inefficiently high interest rates, increasing the cost of borrowing (<a href="http://economics.mit.edu/files/5416">Banerjee and Duflo, 2010</a>). The existence of an over-complicated bureaucratic system will make it time consuming and therefore very costly to start a business and engage in trade. Also, having to pay bribes makes trading more expensive (<a href="http://kie.vse.cz/wp-content/uploads/Svensson-2005.pdf">Svensson 2005</a>). As a result of these additional costs, investors are faced with a lower rate of return when deciding to invest in any new or existing business, and are therefore also less likely to invest. Enterprise, innovation and job creation are restricted as a result, which stalls economic development. In the context of the resource curse, resource rich countries are very likely to see slow economic development when weak institutions are making it very costly for people to invest and benefit from resource profits.</p>
<h3 id="property-rights-and-popular-resource-sovereignty"><em>Property Rights and Popular Resource Sovereignty</em></h3>
<p>One of the most widely discussed examples of a weak institution is the lack of properly defined and enforced property rights. While property rights are a legal rather than economic institution, they are of great relevance to economic development. In a country with strong, enforceable property rights, entrepreneurs are guaranteed to receive the profits of their investment, and therefore have an incentive to operate and innovate. In countries where these rights are lacking, profits may be appropriated or ‘captured’ by the elite, making investment much riskier for the entrepreneur. This directly harms development (<a href="http://economics.mit.edu/files/4471">Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006</a>).</p>
<p>In the case of natural resources, it is interesting to note that natural resources are recognised by international law as belonging to the people of a country, not its sovereign ruler. This is known as popular resource sovereignty. Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights state the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All people have the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.</li>
<li>All peoples may, for their own ends, freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, according to accepted international human rights treaties, all people have the right to determine how their country’s natural resources are managed. In other words, natural resources are the sovereign property of the people, not the companies, governments or rebels who extract them, unless the people decide to assign property or extraction rights to these parties. Natural resource rents therefore also belong to the people. However, in order for popular resource sovereignty to be satisfied, institutions must be in place that allow the people of a country the political and economic freedom to self-determination. For example, in a democracy, people are able to vote in a government to whom they may bestow the right to decide what to do with the country’s natural resources. However, this runs antithesis to many regimes in resource rich countries, which tend to be ruled by authoritarians (Wenar, 2016).</p>
<h3 id="natural-resource-rents-and-authoritarianism"><em>Natural Resource Rents and Authoritarianism</em></h3>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, resource abundant countries are more likely to suffer from authoritarian and corrupt regimes, thus drawing a direct link between resource wealth and poor institutional quality. The philosopher Leif Wenar explains why this situation might be prevalent. According to him, authoritarian rulers have four main sources of income which they may use to hold onto their power. These are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Tax revenues from an economically and politically empowered people</li>
<li>Resource rents</li>
<li>Aid from allies (strategic rents)</li>
<li>Debt from foreign loans.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first of these options implies that citizens must have the political, educational and economic freedoms necessary to generate enough tax income in order to finance an authoritarian regime. However, more often than not this implies that people are so empowered and aware of their own situation that they are in a position to overthrow the regime. Options three and four carry with them additional costs such as military aid or interest payments, which are also undesirable. However, under an authoritarian regime where people are denied popular resource sovereignty, dictators are able to extract resources and use the rents to finance their regime (and line their own pockets) at no extra cost to the regime. The greater the resource endowment, the higher the incentive to act as an authoritarian, as appropriable rents will be higher. Higher rents, in turn, make it easier for a dictator to suppress his or her people, as he or she can afford to bribe people where necessary, while paying to violently suppress opposition. Moreover, because dictators are less reliant on taxes, and have an incentive to keep their people poor and uneducated, they are more likely to restrict economic growth in sectors other than resources by denying its people the institutions and opportunities necessary to facilitate economic activity (Wenar, 2016). Thus, we see that authoritarianism and poor institutions may not only be driving mechanisms of the resource curse, but may in fact be a direct result of resource abundance.</p>
<h2 id="curse-or-choice-does-the-resource-curse-really-exist">Curse or Choice, does the Resource Curse really exist?</h2>
<p>Considering the models and mechanisms discussed above, does the resource curse actually exist? Much research has been done on this topic, but academics still debate whether the curse exists or not. There are proponents, such as Sachs and Warner, and opponents, such as Wright and Czelusta. Their opinions stem from differences in econometric approaches primarily, but also from the causal relationship between institutions and growth. The following section will elaborate on these different perspectives.</p>
<h3 id="the-argument-for"><em>The argument for:</em></h3>
<p>According to Sachs and Warner’s seminal paper (<a href="http://earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/about/director/pubs/EuroEconReview2001.pdf">2001</a>) ‘‘Natural resources and economic development: the curse of natural resources’, empirical support for the resource curse is strong. Sachs and Warner (2001) argue that the resource curse exists because the phenomenon of low economic development in resource rich countries cannot easily be explained by other variables or other ways of measuring resource abundance. In their paper, they show the effect of natural resource extraction on a country’s terms of trade, which ultimately leads to less economic growth (See figure 2).</p>
<p><img style="float: middle;" alt="" src="http://timkovach.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/sachs-warner-2001.jpg"></p>
<p>Figure 2 – Growth and Natural resource abundance 1970-1989 (Sachs &amp; Warner, 2001)</p>
<p>Many other papers find support for the resource curse. Mehlum, H., Moene, K., &amp; Torvik, R. (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01045.x/abstract;jsessionid=B576E96E4C282C4251F0836E54F626DA.f04t01">2006</a>) look at the effect of institutions on the existence of a resource curse. They find a negative relation between natural resources and aggregate income, when institutions are “grabber” friendly, and a positive relation when institutions are “producer” friendly. In “grabber” friendly institutions rent-seeking and production are competing activities, whereas they are complementary in “producer” friendly institutions.</p>
<p>Another paper by Papyrakis, E., &amp; Gerlagh, R. (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596703001392">2004</a>), looks at the direct and indirect effects of natural resource abundance on economic growth. What they find is that natural resources have a negative impact, when considered in isolation. But when you include variables like corruption, investment, openness, terms of trade and schooling in to the regression, they find that natural resources have a positive effect on economic growth. This means that natural resources in itself are not bad for a country, but that the way a country is designed, including its institutions, determines the effect of natural resources on economic growth.</p>
<p>A third paper in favour for the resource curse is that by Stevens, P. (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49517733_Resource_Impact_Curse_of_Blessing_A_literature_survey">2003</a>). In his research Stevens argues for a more initial neutral perspective towards natural resources in a country. Only after you see how a country used and extracted the resource, can you say something about the resource being a curse or a blessing. In this way, Stevens argues that the existence of the resource in itself is not the most important issue, but the way the country is using it is.</p>
<h3 id="the-argument-against"><em>The argument against:</em></h3>
<p>Some economists deny the existence of a curse, as evidence exists of resource rich countries that perform well. As the classic paper by Gavin Wright and Jesse Czelusta (<a href="http://cafehayek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/The-Myth-of-the-Resource-Curse.pdf">2004</a>) ‘The myth of the resource curse’ shows, Norway used its knowledge regarding deep-water drilling platforms to create a new export good. Thus, instead of neglecting the export manufacturing sector, Norway found a way to expand it. Furthermore, the authors argue that other solutions to the resource curse exist, and are primarily related to how resources rents are spent. By ensuring that resource rents are reinvested in valuable assets such as strong institutions or infrastructure that encourage growth in other sectors, the negative effects of the Dutch Disease can be negated.</p>
<p>Another paper arguing against the existence of the resource curse is a research done by Brunnschweiler, C. and Bulte, E. (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069608000193">2008</a>). In their research, Brunnschweiler and Bulte argue that the Resource Curse is mostly a misspecification issue. Abundance of a resource in itself is not a problem, however this drives resource dependence of a country on that one resource. The same holds for the institutions in that county, which also promote resource dependence. In their research they also find that resource dependence does not affect growth, while resource abundance positively affects growth and institutional quality.</p>
<p>In their book, Oil is not a curse, Luong, P. and Weinthal E. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oil-Not-Curse-Institutions-Comparative/dp/0521148081">2010</a>) argue that resource dependence does not need to have a negative effect on economic growth, as long as the country makes the right investment decisions. They argue that most people supporting the Resource Curse, take the level or quality of institutions as a given exogenous variable, instead of an endogenous variable. By including institutions as an endogenous part, they claim that there is no longer a real resource curse problem.</p>
<p>There is also a research by Manzano, O., &amp; Rigobon, R. (<a href="http://web.mit.edu/rigobon/www/Robertos_Web_Page/Research_files/resourcecurse.pdf">2001</a>), where they show two econometric problems with the traditional way of calculating the resource curse. First, they claim that you should include several factors that are correlated with primary exports. Often these factors are not included, while they may affect the results. Secondly, they argue that production in the resource sector has been declining for the last 30 years, so you need to adjust total GDP for this in your regression. After accounting for these two econometric problems, they find that the effect of the resource curse disappears. </p>
<h2 id="answering-some-key-questions-with-real-world-examples">Answering Some Key Questions with Real World Examples</h2>
<h3 id="q.-why-is-africa-so-poor"><em>Q. Why is Africa so poor?</em></h3>
<p>Example Country: Cameroon</p>
<p>Cameroon is located in the west of Africa, and has a population of about 22.5 million people. The GDP of Cameroon is around $30.790 billion, which corresponds to an income of roughly $1.299 per capita. Although there is an abundance of natural resources in Cameroon, it is still a poor country. In this example we show why Cameroon shows signs of the resource curse, and what the consequences of this are for the country.</p>
<p>In 1977 there was a large oil discovery in Cameroon, and this quickly became one of the biggest exports of the country. Before the discovery of oil, exports consisted mostly of coffee and cocoa, and the economy was growing relatively well. After the discovery of oil, there was an economic boom with an average economic growth of 9.4% between 1977 and 1986. This meant however, that the industry of Cameroon switched from the production of several products, to only one product: Oil. This resulted in the Dutch Disease as described above, in which a large part of the investments done in the country were towards the oil sector. From 1987 onwards, so after the initial economic boom from the discovery of oil, things started to turn negatively for Cameroon. Around 1993 income per capita was about half of the 1986 per capita level, and to this date, GDP per capita is still only two thirds of the 1986 per capita income level. How could this be the case?</p>
<p>In Cameroon, roughly two-thirds of all the gains from oil went to the government, and not to private companies. The gains from oil are estimated to be around $20 billion dollars for the Government since 1970. Before the discovery of oil there were a lot of private firms, who exported a variety of products to the world, and provided a lot of opportunities for jobs and local investments. After the discovery of oil, the production of the country switched primarily to the export of oil. The government did not use the gains from the oil sector to invest in its country. So far, only 54% of the profits made from the oil sector even showed up on the government balance sheet, the rest just disappeared. Most of the investments made by the government were not directed towards education or infrastructure, but was spent in an inefficient way, just as a show of power from the government. This under-spending in education and inefficient spending on monuments is a nice example of the problems that arise from the Resource Curse, as mentioned earlier in this canon</p>
<p>While the economic problems that arose in Cameroon already point towards a Resource Curse, there are other underlying issues that the country has. One example of this is a lack of proper institutions. Property rights in Cameroon were not well defined, and thus the Government could claim almost all of the oil rents for themselves. This explains why roughly two thirds of the oil production is owned by the Government. As described before, this lack of institutions in property rights resulted in a small group of people staying into power. They used the oil rents for their own gains, and did not invest it back into the country.</p>
<p>Overall, the discovery of more natural resources, seemed to have a negative impact on the growth and development levels in Cameroon. Although the Oil sector results in a lot of income, a lack of investment in public goods and the country itself result in a net cost for Cameroon. This example shows that more natural resources can actually hinder a country, and thus argues in favour of the existence of the Resource Curse.</p>
<h3 id="q.-what-effect-do-institutions-have-on-the-resource-curse"><em>Q. What effect do institutions have on the Resource Curse?</em></h3>
<p>Example Country: Former Soviet Union</p>
<p>As already mentioned the resource curse and the state of institutions are correlated. We look at the example of the Soviet Union, which fell apart in 1991. The successor states included Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, The Russian Federation, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. They all inherited very similar weak state institutions. However, the development of the public sector after the separation had great effect on how economic growth reacted to the ownership structure of oil. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan focused on expanding the public sector, which owned and controlled more than 50% of the oil sector. Azerbaijan also chose a state ownership structure but without control, owning less than 50% of the oil sector, and including foreign involvement. Lastly, Russia chose domestic private ownership and Kazakhstan chose a foreign private ownership structure of the oil sector.</p>
<p>Russia and Kazakhstan were better able to overcome their bad institutions and thus mitigate the effects of the resource curse, as can be seen in this graph of GDP per capita after the fall of the Soviet Union (See figure 3):</p>

<p>One explanation for their success was the strong enforcement of private property in the oil sector for Russia and Kazakhstan. This made it more difficult for the state to rely on natural resources as its sole revenue base, meaning that they had to develop alternative fiscal resources. Moreover, the private sector were able to use their greater bargaining power to demand better fiscal institutions when property rights for the oil sector were changed, since they suffered from bad ones. So, this example shows that self-determination of resources, adequate property rights, more democratic systems, and overall good institutional quality encourage economic growth and help overcome the resource curse.</p>
